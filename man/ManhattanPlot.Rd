ManhattanPlot(
  results = NULL,
  plot.quantity = "PosteriorProbability",
  results.vector = NULL,
  covariates.to.include = NULL,
  var.dictionary = NULL,
  plot.title = "Manhattan Plot",

}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A R2BGLiMS R2BGLiMS_Results-class object frum running the R2BGLiMS R2BGLiMS command.}

\item{plot.quantity}{Can be "PosteriorProbability" (default), "BayesFactor", "ABF", or "pvalue". The
latter is implemented to allow easy comparison between analysis frameworks using the same plot style,
and only works if a vector of p-values is supplied. ABF is for plotting Approximate Bayes Factors
in favour of the null (i.e. small values correspond to evidence of association), as proposed in
Wakefield, J. (2009). Genetic Epidemiology.}

\item{results.vector}{Alternatively can simply pass a named vector of probabilties}

\item{covariates.to.include}{Character vector indicating a subset of covariates to include in the plot.}

\item{var.dictionary}{Character vector containing a mapping of covariate names to substitutions for the plot. The names of the elements are
the variable names as in the original analysis (i.e. as named in the results object).}

\item{plot.title}{Optional character string to name the plot with}

\item{y.max}{If plotting Bayes Factors, this is an optional upper limit for the y-axis (e.g.
to make comparison with a different set of results easier on the eye). Note that if p-values are
being plotted, then this can be used to supply the maximum -log10(p-value) on the y-axis.}

\item{add.bonferroni}{If plotting p-values this option draws a dashed red line at the Bonferroni
threshold. (default is TRUE).}

\item{top.hits}{If a list of "top hits" are provided here, along with the original X matrix below,
then the points are coloured according to their pairwise correlation with the "top hits" (default NULL)}

\item{X.mat}{Must be provided if top.hits are provided above - used to calculate pairwise correlations.}

\item{point.cols}{Optional vector of colours to use for the points (as many and in the same
order as the covariates)}

\item{point.labs}{Optional vector of labels to use for the points (as many and in the same
order as the covariates)}

\item{include.var.names.on.x.axis}{Set to TRUE to avoid adding x tick mark labels (e.g. if there are many many
variables)}
