#' GWAS data for three latent traits from a subset of the INTERVAL data that has no missing trait measurements
#' This is a list of three latent trait GWAS data.frames, where each data.frame has columns rsID, beta, EAF, P_value
#' These latent traits (ML4, ML12, ML14) are all related to red blood cell traits and our analyses suggest that 
#' rs1175550 is the causal variant for all three traits, which is in agreement with UKBB fine-mapping [(Vuckovic et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.008) previous studies [(Cvejic et al. 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2603)
#' Original INTERVAL GWAS data are available in [Astle et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042) 
#' and [Akbari et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40679-y)
