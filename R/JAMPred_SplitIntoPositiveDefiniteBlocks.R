#' For a list of snps and corresponding individual level reference genotypes, this function can be used to split
#' the SNPs into blocks of positive definite correlation structure, i.e. for use with JAMPred. After starting with
#' an initial partitioning of the SNPs, either provided according to LD information, or naively formed based on 
#' a user specified initial block size, this function identifies any blocks which do not have infertible genotype
#' matrices and splits them until all blocks have positive definite genotype matrices in the reference data.
#' @export
#' @title Splits a list of SNPs into positive definite blocks.
#' @name JAMPred_SplitIntoPositiveDefiniteBlocks
#' @param snps List of SNPs to be split into blocks
#' @param initial.block.size Block size for the initial partitioning. Default is 100. This is ignored when initial.snps.blocks is given.
#' @param initial.snps.blocks A user specified initial partitioning of the SNPs. This must be a list, each element of which is a vector of SNP
#' names that correspond to the columns of ref.geno. This could be defined, for example, according to LD information.
#' @param ref.geno Reference genotype matrix. Rows are people, columns are SNPs (named according to the vector snps) and elements are between 
#' 0 and 2 (can be dosages).
#' 
#' @return A list each element of which is a vector of SNP names.
