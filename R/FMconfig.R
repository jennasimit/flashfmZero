#' List of FINEMAP config file contents for two simulated traits 
#' 
#' Simulated data was generated using the mvrnorm function in R and genotype matrix X. The two traits have correlation 0.4 and 
#' each has two causal variants, of which one, rs61839660 is shared between traits; trait 1 has second 
#' causal variant rs62626317 and trait 2 has second causal variant rs11594656. The traits are from a sample
#' of 2000, with no missing measurements.
#' 
#' FINEMAP (Benner, 2016) was run on each trait. The first list data.frame is the config file contents 
#' for trait 1, and the second list data.frame are those for trait 2.
